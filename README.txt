run this code in command line

** do not remove any file in the folder **

Open main_src.py

In the input parameter section
variable ''theta'' is threshold probability for the given circuit
variable ''it'' is no of iterations for DE algorithm
variable ''psize'' is population size for DE algorithm

variable ''ckt'' is circuit name for the given circuit.
variable ''node'' is  node for the given circuit.
variable ''loc'' is location of the trojan for the given circuit
variable ''trj'' is trojan number for the given circuit

example:

if the file name is 4_bit_ripple_adder_trojan2_location1_nodeC1.v:
then,
ckt = '4_bit_ripple_adder'
node = 'C1'
loc = '1'
trj = '2'

then run the program

the outputs are displayed in the python console

the files are in 
folder: 'Patterns/verilog/'
